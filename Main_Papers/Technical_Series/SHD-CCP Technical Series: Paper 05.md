Title: Stability Proofs via Derrick’s Theorem and the Quaternion Packet

The "Einstein Tile" as the Minimal Stable Unit

Reference: Proof of Stability Document; Derrick's Theorem

1. The Problem: Scalar Instability

In functional analysis applied to General Relativity, a static, localized unit of information (a "scalar point") is unstable. Derrick’s Theorem proves that for a real scalar field, the energy functional has no stable minimum.


$$\frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial \lambda^2} < 0$$


This means a simple "bit" of data in curved spacetime will either collapse to a singularity (Black Hole) or disperse to infinity.

2. The Solution: The BioChain "Einstein Tile"

To create a stable computational substrate, we must move from Real Scalars ($\mathbb{R}$) to Complex Quaternions ($\mathbb{H}$). The SHD-CCP packet (the "Einstein Tile") is a 64-bit Quaternion Packet that acts as a Topological Soliton (Skyrmion).

3. The Stability Proof

We introduce a Conserved Topological Charge ($Q$) via the Spin Class bits in the packet.

The Stability Mechanism:

Topological Barrier: As the scale $\lambda \to 0$ (collapse), the kinetic energy of the phase rotation scales as $Q^2 / \lambda^2$. This term blows up to positive infinity, physically preventing the collapse into a singularity.

Dual-Sheet Locking: The architecture uses a Nested Clifford Torus (Dual-Sheet).


$$E_{total} \approx E_{primary}(\lambda) + E_{inverse}(1/\lambda)$$


The sum of these sheets creates a stable energy well at $\lambda = 1$.

4. Conclusion

The SHD-CCP packet is not just data; it is a physically stable soliton. By implementing the Quaternion structure and Dual-Sheet topology, the system satisfies the requirements of Functional Analysis for existence in a relativistic environment, solving the "Singularity Collapse" problem.
