Title: Topological Expansion via Minimal Surface Doubling of the Clifford Torus

Modeling Discrete Expansion without Rupture

Reference: "New Minimal Surface Doublings of the Clifford Torus" (Kapouleas & McGrath)

1. The Problem: Discrete Expansion

How does the universe expand from "One" to "Many"? The Big Bang posits an explosion. A computational model requires a Doubling function—a mechanism to go from 1 sphere to 2 spheres without breaking topological continuity.

2. The SHD-CCP Solution: Clifford Torus Doubling

The SHD-CCP models expansion using the mathematics of Minimal Surface Doubling in $\mathbb{S}^3$.

Base Surface: The Clifford Torus ($\mathbb{T}$).

Mechanism: Connecting two copies of the surface via Catenoidal Bridges arranged along parallel copies of torus knots.

3. The Construction (Kapouleas-McGrath)

The system uses Linearized Doubling (LD) solutions to glue surfaces together.

Parameters: Torus knots $(a, b)$, number of strands $k$, and number of bridges $m$.

Result: A new smooth, embedded minimal surface of genus $km + 1$.


$$|\tilde{M}| \approx 2|\mathbb{T}| - \text{Bridge Area}$$

4. Implications for Cosmology

This provides a rigorous mathematical model for the "Base-2 Sphere Doubling at Planck Scale."

Instead of a singularity exploding, we have a Clifford Torus doubling itself.

The "Catenoidal Bridges" act as the wormholes or flux tubes connecting the discrete Planck-spheres.

This proves that space can expand discretely (doubling) while maintaining a smooth, minimal-energy topology.

5. Conclusion

The SHD-CCP replaces the "Big Bang" with a "Big Compilation"—a recursive doubling of Clifford Tori governed by minimal surface equations, providing a precise, non-singular mechanism for cosmic expansion.
