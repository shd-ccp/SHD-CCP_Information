Title: Geometric Calibration of Planck Scales via LCM Constraints

Deriving the 72-Node Lattice from Natural Limits

Reference: SHD-CCP Codex Section 7.1

1. The Problem: Arbitrary Units

Standard models often treat Planck units (Planck length, Planck time) as arbitrary constants plugged into equations. To resolve the singularity, the computational substrate itself must be calibrated to these natural limits.

2. The Solution: The LCM Construction

The 72-Node Lattice is not an arbitrary engineering choice. It is derived as the Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of the fundamental symmetries required to describe matter and force at the Planck scale.

The Constraints:

Forces (Bosons): Require Tri-Stream symmetry ($N \mod 3 = 0$).

Space (Dimensions): Require Quad-Tier symmetry for 3D coordinates + Time ($N \mod 4 = 0$).

Matter (Fermions): Require Hexagonal Packing efficiency ($N \mod 6 = 0$).

The Derivation:

64 (Binary) satisfies 4, but fails 3 and 6.

72 is the first integer to satisfy all three.


$$LCM(3, 4, 6) \to \text{Scaled to word size} \to 72$$

3. Geometric Calibration

By setting the node-to-node distance of the 72-node lattice to the Planck Length, the system becomes a direct pixelation of physical reality. The "natural units" cease to be constants and become the geometric stride of the computational torus.

4. Conclusion

The SHD-CCP integrates Natural Units by aligning its bit-width and node-count with the fundamental LCM constraints of physical symmetry, ensuring the architecture is "tuned" to the resonance of the Planck scale.
