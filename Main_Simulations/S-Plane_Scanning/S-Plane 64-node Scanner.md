This program is a sophisticated visual simulation of a **64-bit SHD-CCP (Symbolic High Dimensional Context Compression Protocol) Packet**. It models how complex data can be "etched" into a static geometric structure using time-based topology rather than just binary states.

Here is a quick breakdown of its capabilities:

**1. The Geometric Substrate (The Hardware)**
It visualizes a **4x4x4 Lattice of 64 Nodes**, where each node represents a bit with dynamic properties (Energy, Weight, Pulse). The center is protected by a **Quaternion TMA Core** (the purple cube), which acts as the immutable orientation anchor for the packet.

**2. Topological Etching (The Input)**
Instead of writing data linearly, the system uses **6 External Etchers** (red cones) that orbit the packet. As the system cycles through **720° (Spinor Rotation)**, these etchers fire laser pulses into specific nodes based on the packet's current geometric perspective. This allows the system to store a 3D "Chain of Thought" or temporal signature into the lattice.

**3. Neural Physics (The Processing)**
The nodes behave like a neural network. You can control the **Drift Physics** (Implosive, Explosive, Resonant) to determine how energy settles in the system. Nodes with high activity gain "Weight" (Gravitational Memory), biasing future data flows toward established pathways.

**4. Analysis Tools (The Readout)**

* **Holographic Wrap:** A visual mode where energy distorts the lattice into a vortex, showing how "heavy" data sinks to the center.
* **3D Heatmap:** A top-down view of energy density.
* **Wave Function Analyzer:** Compares the lattice's output against an ideal Zeta function.
* **Codex Log:** Calculates a real-time "Hash" of the system based on total energy, used to verify data integrity.
